Program generates executables oss and user. OSS acts as a sudo operating system and calls
fork/execs to user. User waits for a moment of time, sends a shared memory flag to oss,
dies, then OSS calls another fork. Using a semaphore, race conditions can be prevented.

 -- HELP MENU --
-h                    open help menu
-s (int)              specify number of user processes allowed to run at once
-l filename           filename of the log file

*** The makefile only cleans text files called 'text.txt' Cleaning all text files could be dangerous.

All parts of those project work besides the use of semaphores. My best attempt is
commented out inline. Slowing down the oss timer and putting a wait on the user 
processes shows more clearly the workflow.
